# Secure CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

This repository contains a **secure CI/CD pipeline** implemented using **GitHub Actions**. 
The pipeline ensures code integrity,
security scanning, and controlled deployments to Kubernetes using Helm.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline is structured into the following stages:

### 1. Security Scans

Ensures that the code, dependencies, and infrastructure configurations
are secure before deployment.

- **Static Code Analysis (Bandit)** â†’ Detects vulnerabilities in
Python code. 
- **Dependency Scanning (Snyk)** â†’ Checks for
vulnerabilities in project dependencies. 
- **Infrastructure Scanning (Checkov)** â†’ Scans Terraform configurations for security misconfigurations.

### 2. Build & Test
Validates code functionality before deployment.
- Runs **unit tests** using **PyTest**. 
- Uploads test results for review and analysis.

### 3. Container Security & Build

Builds and secures the containerized application.

- Builds a **Docker image** for the application. 
- Runs **Trivy** for **vulnerability scanning** of the container image. 
- Pushes the **secure image** to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.

### 4. Deployment to Kubernetes

Deploys the application securely using Kubernetes.

- Uses **Helm** to manage Kubernetes deployments. 
- Leverages **GitHub Secrets** for storing Kubernetes credentials securely.

## Workflow Implementation

This CI/CD pipeline is defined in the
\`.github/workflows/secure-ci-cd.yml\` file and is triggered on
**push** and **pull requests** to the \`main\` branch.

### Key Features of the Secure Pipeline

- âœ… **Branch protection**: Ensures that security checks run before merging changes.
- âœ… **Secret management**: Uses **GitHubSecrets** to store sensitive credentials. 
- âœ… **Automated security testing**: Detects vulnerabilities before deployment. 
- âœ… **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) support**: Securely stores built images. 
- âœ… **Kubernetes deployment with Helm**: Ensures a robust and scalable deployment process.

## Imporvments

- Enable **GitHub Actions Required Status Checks** to enforce security tests. 
- Implement **progressive deployment strategies** (Blue-Green or Canary). 
- Integrate **runtime security monitoring** with tools like **Falco**.
